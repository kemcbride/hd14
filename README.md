<h1>SE HackDay '14</h1>
Well, this was my idea. A script that takes a sprite sheet, and outputs a "useful" css sheet.

As of now, it "iffily" works on regularly-spaced sprite sheets.
You also have to know the size (px) of each <emph>square</emph> sprite, and the number of rows and columns. Exactly that.

The idea was supposed to be more complex. And might become so.
The example "gspoke.css" should be a good example of it working.

Some possible "good ideas":
<ul>
<li>not needing to know # rows, columns</li>
<li>not needing to know sprite size</li>
<li>not needing to have 'square' sprites</li>
<li>ensuring that the backgrounds of the sprites are transparent</li>
<li>probably more...</li>
</ul>

Fingers crossed!
